This is a `minimalistic implementation of Joint Time-Frequency Scattering <https://github.com/gptanon/wavespon/tree/main/examples/jtfs-min>`_, useful for learning. 
It implements JTFS with most arguments fixed. Meaningfully, this implementation differs as follows:

 - Only spinned coefficients are computed
 - Frequential filterbank structure mimics `Scattering1D`'s
 - Most of compute-relevant quantities are computed at runtime rather than build time
 - Frequential padding is always maxed (though not necessarily sufficient), so `n2`-dependence is dropped
 - Frequential averaging is always done. Simple enough to understand unaveraged case from code, and to obtain approx. unaveraged coeffs via `F=1`
 - `out_3D=True; aligned=True; pad_mode=pad_mode_fr="zero"`
 - No energy correction
 - Otherwise, the implementation is complete and can be studied as a mostly correct JTFS.

Fixed arguments:
