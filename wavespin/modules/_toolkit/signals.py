    """Collection of various signals useful for edge case testing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        Length of signals to generate.

    names : list[str] / None
        Names of signals to generate. "Supported `names`" below.

    sc : Scattering1D / TimeFrequencyScattering1D
        Required for any `names` containing 'adversarial'.

    e_th : float
        Parameter for signals whose names contain 'adversarial'.

    Returns
    -------
    waves : dict[str: tensor/list[tensor]]
        Name-signal pairs.

    Supported `names`
    -----------------

      - 'randn': White Gaussian Noise, 0-mean, 1-std.
          General-purpose "if it works on this, it works".

      - 'pink': pink noise, i.e. WGN whose spectrum is scaled by 1/freq^2.
          Much more "uniform" in spectral energy distribution for scattering,
          since CWT frequencies are log-scaled. That is, same energy per unit
          frequency interval doesn't mean same energy per unit log-frequency:
          it'll be much less for lower frequencies, inflating the effective SNR.

      - 'impulse': unit impulse, centered. `x=zeros(N); x[N//2] = 1`.
          Possibly the chief "adversarial example" for scattering total energy
          conservation. Reliable surrogate for "silences" in data, which can lose
          surprising amounts of energy.
          Must be paired with `pad_mode='zero' for intended results.

      - 'constant': flat line. `x=ones(N)`.
          Is both the best and the worst case for energy conservation.
          All of energy will be in zeroth order, so perfect conservation, but
          zeroth order is typically tossed out.
          Must be paired with `pad_mode='reflect'` for intended results.

      - 'impulse-train': uniform sequence of impulses. `x=zeros(N); x[::spc]=1`.
          Requires many second-order coefficients if first order has high
          time resolution (low `Q` / high `r_psi`) to not lose information.
          Good edge case for high time localization.

      - 'adversarial-am': amplitude-modulated cosines tailored to `sc`.
          Good (but not optimal) adversarial example for second-order energy
          conservation, used for determining whether second-order wavelets can
          be safely excluded.

          See `help(adversarial_am)`. This is multiple signals in a list.

      - 'adversarial-impulse-train': uniformly-spaced deltas tailored to `sc`.
          Is the one-signal version of 'adversarial-am'.
