def compute_spatial_support(pf, criterion_amplitude=1e-3, guarantee_decay=False):
    """Compute spatial support of `pf` as the interval, in number of samples,
    where sum of envelope (absolute value) inside it is `1 / criterion_amplitude`
    times greater than outside.

    Used for avoiding boundary effects and incomplete filter decay. Accounts for
    tail decay, but with lessser weight than the Heisgenberg resolution measure
    for monotonic decays (i.e. no bumps/spikes). For prioritizing the main lobe,
    see `measures.compute_temporal_width()`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pf : np.ndarray, 1D
        Filter, in frequency domain.

        Assumes that the time-domain waveform, `ifft(pf)`, is centered at index
        `0` (for Morlets & Gaussians, this means `argmax(abs(ifft(pf))) == 0`).

    criterion_amplitude : float
        Computes `criterion_ratio` as `1/criterion_amplitude`.

    guarantee_decay : bool (default False)
        In practice, this is identical to `True`, though `True` will still return
        a slightly more conservative estimate for Morlets & Gaussians.
        See `help(wavespin.scattering1d.filter_bank._integral_ratio_bound)`.

    Returns
    -------
    support : int
        Total temporal support of `pf`, measured in samples ("total" as opposed to
        only right or left part).

    Note
    ----
    The simple version of this algorithm is to find the first point, away from
    center of `pt` (ifft(pf)), that drops below `criterion_amplitude * pt.max()`,
    and multiply by 2. That yields the same result as `guarantee_decay=True` for
    Morlets & Gaussians.

    Details
    -------
    Mathematically, this bounds the point-wise (at each shift) error of
    convolution in terms of relative contributions of each point (each dot-mult)
    to the aggregation step. In continuous time, it's an L1 integral

        $A = \int_{start}^{end} |\psi(t)| dt$
        $B = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(t)| dt$

    with `start` and `end` such that `A / (B - A) > 1 / criterion_amplitude`.
    That is, for `criterion_amplitude=1e-3`, it's `inside / outside > 1000`.
    Hence, all points outside the support interval, combined, contribute x1000
    less to the result than all the points inside. `support == end - start`.

    Alternative formulation
    -----------------------

    Find `S = support` such that

        A = ||conv(x, \psi_S) - conv(x, \psi)||
        B = ||conv(x, \psi)||
        A / B < criterion_amplitude

    that is, the relative Euclidean distance between the infinite duration
    (completely untrimmed) filter and the filter trimmed to S, is less than
    `criterion_amplitude`. This is well-motivated, and practically the first
    formulation warrants the second, with the spec of `criterion_amplitude=1e-3`
    in former yielding `1e-3` to `1e-2` in latter. However, it is ultimately
    ill-conditioned and lacks utility:

        1. Any change in `psi` can be exploited to maximize the total convolution
           Euclidean distance well beyond the intended `criterion_amplitude`.
           This is confirmed with gradient descent.
           Practically, this isn't a major point, but this incompleteness limits
           precise filter design and additional criteria are required.

        2. The criterion can be satisfied even in cases of incomplete decay,
           yielding finite `support < N`. This defeats the purpose.

        3. This measure offers no direct description on how much padding should
           be used to avoid boundary effects, as it is an aggregate measure over
           the entire convolution, whereas boundary effects are localized.

        4. The result of interest unpads, hence includes contributions of padding,
           and yields different bounds depending on `pad_mode`. An upper bound can
           be found via padless circular convolution (surrogate for any general
           padding), but for `S > len(x_unpadded)` the discrepancy is great.

        Defaults to `len(p_f) // 2`.

    pts_per_scale : int
        Used only in `fast=False`: number of Gaussians generated per dyadic
        scale. Greater improves approximation accuracy but is slower.

    fast : bool (default True)
        Fast approximation of the full algorithm. See "Fast algorithm".

    sigma0, criterion_amplitude : float, float
        See `help(wavespin.scattering1d.filter_bank.gauss_1d)`. Parameters
        defining the Gaussian lowpass used as reference for computing `width`.
        That is, `width` is defined *in terms of* this Gaussian.

    Returns
    -------
    width: int[>=1]
        The estimated width of `p_f`, in number of samples.

    Motivation
    ----------
    The measure is, a relative L2 distance (Euclidean distance relative to
    input norms) between inner products of `p_f` with an input, at different
    time shifts (i.e. `L2(A, B); A = sum(p(t) * x(t)), B = sum(p(t) * x(t - T))`).

      - The time shift is made to be "maximal", i.e. half of unpadded output
        length (`N/2`), which provides the most sensitive measure to "width".
      - The input is a Dirac delta, thus we're really measuring distances between
        impulse responses of `p_f`, or of `p_f` with itself. This provides a
        measure that's close to that of input being WGN, many-trials averaged.

    This yields `l2_reference`. It's then compared against `l2_Ts`, which is
    a list of measures obtained the same way except replacing `p_f` with a fully
    decayed (undistorted) Gaussian lowpass - and the `l2_T` which most closely
    matches `l2_reference` is taken to be the `width`.

    The interpretation is, "width" of `p_f` is the width of the (properly decayed)
    Gaussian lowpass that imposes the same amount of invariance that `p_f` does.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    The actual algorithm is different, since L2 is a problematic measure with
    unpadding; there's ambiguity: `T=1` can be measured as "closer" to `T=64`
    than `T=63`). Namely, we take inner product (similarity) of `p_f` with
    Gaussians at varied `T`, and the largest such product is the `width`.
    The result is very close to that described under "Motivation", but without
    the ambiguity that requires correction steps.

    Fast algorithm
    --------------
    Approximates `fast=False`. If `p_f` is fully decayed, the result is exactly
    same as `fast=False`. If `p_f` is very wide (nearly global average), the
    result is also same as `fast=False`. The disagreement is in the intermediate
    zone, but is not significant.

    We compute `ratio = p_t.max() / p_t.min()`, and compare against a fully
    decayed reference. For the intermediate zone, a quadratic interpolation
    is used to approximate `fast=False`.

    Assumption
    ----------
    `abs(p_t)`, where `p_t = ifft(p_f)`, is assumed to be Gaussian-like.
    An ideal measure is devoid of such an assumption, but is difficult to devise
    in finite sample settings.

    Note
    ----
    `width` saturates at `N` past a certain point in "incomplete decay" regime.
    The intution is, in incomplete decay, the measure of width is ambiguous:
    for one, we lack compact support. For other, the case `width == N` is a
    global averaging (simple mean, dc, etc), which is really `width = inf`.

    If we let the algorithm run with unrestricted `T_max`, we'll see `width`
    estimates blow up as `T -> N` - but we only seek to quantify invariance
    up to `N`. Also, Gaussians of widths `T = N - const` and `T = N` have
    very close L2 measures up to a generous `const`; see `test_global_averaging()`
    in `tests/scattering1d/test_jtfs.py` for `T = N - 1` (and try e.g. `N - 64`).

    """Compute bandwidth of `pf` as the interval, in number of samples, where
    energy inside of it is `(1/criterion_amplitude)**2` times greater than
    outside.

    Computes the "information bandwidth", measuring the greatest possible
    subsampling factor without losing information (within tolerance). It holds
    irrespective of center frequency (there may be aliasing, but
    aliasing != lossy). With a sufficient sampling rate, this directly corresponds
    to bandwidth of the unaliased and (approx.) bandlimited original continuous
    frequency-domain function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pf : np.ndarray, 1D
        Filter, in frequency domain.

    criterion_amplitude : float
        Computes `criterion_ratio` as `(1/criterion_amplitude)**2`.
        The `1/` is just for code clarity, what matters is the `**2`.

    return_sided : bool (default False)
        Whether to parts of bandwidth to left and right of `c` separately.
        The parts will sum to one greater than the single result returned by
        `False`, as they each include `c`.

    center_input : bool (default True)
        Will center `pf` about `c`, that is, `np.roll(pf, -c + len(pf)//2)`.

        The motivation is to disambiguate "bandwidth". For `pf` that's any
        general waveform, which can be aliased or non-bandlimited, what counts
        as "bandwidth" isn't uniquely-defined. In continuous-time, a pre-aliased,
        bandlimited `pf` lies on a *contiguous* interval between sampling bounds
        (Nyquist zones). Centering `pf` hence allows the computation of largest
        such contiguous interval, where circularity is deliberately disregarded.

        An example of ambiguity is a Morlet near DC, which typically leaks into
        negatives. Without centering, this yields maximum bandwidth, `== N - 1`,
        as the spectrum spans all the way from bin 1 (no DC) to -1. Yet, this
        result isn't useful in any important sense, and contradicts the basic
        notion that high bandwidth = high time localization.

    c : str['peak'] / int
        Specifies the centering index, since it's not necessarily the peak
        in the general case. `'peak'` sets it to `argmax(abs(pf))`.

    guarantee_decay : bool (default False)
        In practice, this is identical to `True`, though `True` returns a
        slightly more conservative estimate for Morlets & Gaussians.
        See `help(wavespin.scattering1d.filter_bank._integral_ratio_bound)`.

    Returns
    -------
    bandwidth : int
        Bandwidth of `pf`, measured in samples.

    Details
    -------
    The measure is identical to that of `compute_spatial_support` except it
    uses L2^2 (energy) rather than L1.

    Energy because it's the conserved quantity. That is, it's the only quantity
    that's conserved between the spatial and frequency domains, via
    Parseval-Plancherel's theorem. Hence a measure in one domain can be used
    as a measure of both - in this case, effect of aliasing on time-domain result.

    The measure quantifies aliasing in terms of the total effect of folding.
    The added (aliased) energies in total are, with `criterion_amplitude=1e-3`,
    x1,000,000 less than energies being added onto. If the filter is

        [p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7]

    then subsampling by 2 makes it

        [p0 + p4, p1 + p5, p2 + p6, p3 + p7]

    and we seek to keep this result as close as possible to

        [p0, p1, p6, p7]

    which we accomplish via

        A = sum(abs([p0, p1, p6, p7])**2)
        B = sum(abs([p2, p3, p4, p5])**2)
        A / B > (1 / criterion_amplitude)**2

    Alternative formulation
    -----------------------
    For aliasing, ideally we'd guarantee that the ratio of aliased and unaliased
    energies is controlled by `criterion_amplitude`, but that's not what this
    measure does, as bin energies aren't linear in addition:
    `(p0 + p1)**2 != p0**2 + p1**2`. However, it's close enough in practice,
    and this alt metric has important drawbacks:

        1. It doesn't interpret as a generalized information measure, as it
           depends on center frequency in addition to bandwidth.
           E.g. two Gaussians with identical `sigma` but different frequency
           shifts will have different bandwidths.
        2. It isn't suited for measuring losses due to lowpass filtering
           (note, this doesn't involve subsampling or aliasing), whereas the used
           metric (energy) can directly quantify it in time-domain losses.

        is circular: `hstack([pf[idx_left:], pf[:idx_right + 1])`.

    Indexing formulation
    --------------------
    `bw_idxs` slices `pf` contiguously, including circularly. This introduces
    negative indexing. The conversion is, where `l, r = bw_idxs` and `r` is
    never negative:

    ::
        if l < 0:
            slc = np.hstack([pf[l:], pf[:r + 1]])
        else:
            slc = pf[l:r + 1]

    Indexing non-uniqueness
    -----------------------
    "Bandwidth" here follows the definition of `compute_bandwidth`. The indexing
    hence isn't uniquely-defined for any arbitrary 1D sequence `pf`, even with `c`
    known, since determination of `l` and `r` is non-unique.

        - An example is a ramp, `np.arange(16)`, which is what's approximately
          produced by a heavily aliased Morlet, e.g. `morlet_1d(256, .99, .99)`.
          The most natural indexing is `pf[:N]`, yet if we follow the evolution
          of the Morlet, this always changes, starting from the unaliased case
          which wraps from right to left. In this example it's unclear what is
          "correct" to begin with, but it's to illustrate the problem.

    Subsampling criterion: general vs analytic
    ------------------------------------------
    Suppose N=8, and we subsample by 2. Since subsampling <=> folding, we have

        [p0, p1, p2, p3,
         p4, p5, p6, p7]
        -->
        [p0 + p4, p1 + p5, p2 + p6, p3 + p7]

    We require

        [p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7]
        -->
        [p0, p1, p6, p7]

    which is only achieved if p4=p5=p2=p3=0:

        [p0, p1, 0, 0, 0, 0, p6, p7]

    Yet, for `p` real in time, this requires `p2=p6`, which aliases. If `p`
    isn't real, then we can't tell whether third slot in subsampled came from
    `p6` or `p2`, or both. In short, having Nyquist bin == aliasing. Unless,
    that is, we *know* it came from `p2`, which we do due to analyticity.
    This does require `analytic=True`, but to not introduce additional dependence
    to scattering output size, we treat `analytic=False` the same via
    `for_scattering=True` - the difference is likely to be small anyway.

    The analytic case is thus

        [p0, p1, p2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -->
        [p0, p1, p2, 0]

    Extended discussion: https://dsp.stackexchange.com/q/83781/50076

    Note: information bandwidth
    ---------------------------
    This measure strives to avoid aliasing, which is stricter than avoiding
    loss of information. Latter may vary with context depending on goal, but
    the most general measure provides the upper bound: N // bw.

    Here we take close to half of that upper bound. One can note, `bmax = bw - 1`
    in best case (bw can be yet larger), which holds with `analytic=True`, and
    we do N // 2 / bmax, so it's not exact halving. This concerns keeping
    positive and negative bins positive and negative, and the folding boundary
    is offest by DC and Nyquist bins, hence the adjustment.
    However, two special cases defy this pattern:

        - bw=1 -> N/2**j=1: no positives or negatives. Alpha is omega.
        - bw=2 -> N/2**j=2: positive is negative (Nyquist). Yin is yang.

    The `bw=2` case isn't coded explicitly due to a numeric coincidence:

        N // 2 / (bw - 1) == N // bw

    also since the code would be verbose.

    interval : int / tuple[int]

    Decay note
    ----------
    With `guarantee_decay=False`, this method fails the "flat line test", in that
    we can pass in `np.ones(N)` and get `<N` for output, for a sufficiently large
    `N`. This is intentional, as the method assures that contents inside the
    yielded interval outweigh the contents outside of it by a factor of
    `criterion_ratio`. In context of

        - boundary effects / temporal decay, convolution: contents outside the
          interval will contribute at most `1/criterion_ratio` to the output.
        - aliasing, subsampling: frequencies outside the interval will overlap
          (fold, alias onto) with those inside the interval by at most
          `1/criterion_ratio**2` (measure='energy') of inside's energy.

    If this still isn't desired, an additional criterion guarantees "decay"
    occurs - that there is a point, `i`, that's below some fraction of the peak:

        p.max() / p[i] > criterion_ratio/2

    checked separately to left and to right of `c`. Ensures no point *after* `i`
    fails the ratio, i.e. it's really `p.max() / p[i:].max()`, to account for
    cases where `p` first decays and then rises again.

    Interval note
    -------------
    The method *defines* `interval` to span around index `len(p)//2`, so if we
    pass in something centered elsewhere with `center_input=False` or wrong `c`,
    the results are inaccurate.

    For example, `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]` outputs `8`, even though we may want
    `3`, but the `8` interpretation is valid for both convolution and aliasing.
