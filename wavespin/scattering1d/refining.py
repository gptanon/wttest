def smart_paths_exclude(psi1_f, psi2_f, e_loss=.01, level=1, e_th_direct=None):
    """Intelligently excludes second-order temporal paths that are likely to be
    uninformative and contribute minimal energy to scattering coefficients.

    The explanation of the algorithm remains proprietary for the time being.
    In a nutshell, it's a rigorously developed and correct version of the
    `j2 > j1` criterion used by some libraries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    psi1_f : list[dict]
        `sc.psi1_f`, where `sc` is `Scattering1D` or `TimeFrequencyScattering1D`.

    psi2_f : list[dict]
        `sc.psi2_f`, where `sc` is `Scattering1D` or `TimeFrequencyScattering1D`.

    e_loss : float[>0, <1]
        Energy loss threshold. No more than this fraction of energy will be lost
        relative to the full transform. See `smart_paths` in
        `wavespin.scattering1d.frontend.base_frontend.Scattering1D`.

    level : int
        Conservativeness of the algorithm; higher means greater guarantee, but
        less paths excluded. See `smart_paths` in
        `wavespin.scattering1d.frontend.base_frontend.Scattering1D`.

    e_th_direct : float [>0, <1] / None
        `e_loss` is used to set `e_th`, an internal parameter used by the
        algorithm to exclude wavelets. `e_th_direct` bypasses `e_loss` to set
        `e_th` directly, which can be useful for debugging.

    Returns
    -------
    paths_exclude_smart : dict[str: list[int]]
        Second-order temporal paths to exclude, e.g. `{'n2': [0, 1, 2]}`.

    (e.g. time scattering for real inputs) or 1 for analytic + anti-analytic.
    This makes the filterbank energy non-expansive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    psi_fs0 : list[np.ndarray]
        Analytic filters (also spin up for frequential).

    psi_fs1 : list[np.ndarray] / None
        Anti-analytic filters (spin down). If None, filterbank is treated as
        analytic-only, and LP peaks are scaled to 2 instead of 1.

    phi_f : np.ndarray / None
        Lowpass filter. If `log2_T < J`, will exclude from computation as
        it will excessively attenuate low frequency bandpasses.

    J, log2_T : int, int
        See `phi_f`. For JTFS frequential scattering these are `J_fr, log2_F`.

    is_recalibrate : bool (default False)
        Used with `warn=True`, setting the threshold for number of peak
        duplicates to `3` if `True`, else `2`, since 'recalibrate' with high
        `psi_id` and insufficient padding greatly increases duplication odds.

    warn : bool (default False)
        Whether to warn about found duplicate peaks degrading energy norm.
        Defaults to False since we already warn of degradation in frontend.

    passes : int
        Number of times to call this function recursively; see Algorithm.

    scaling_factors : None / dict[float]
        Used internally if `passes > 1`.

    Returns
    -------
    scaling_factors : None / dict[float]
        Used internally if `passes > 1`.


    Algorithm
    ---------
    Wavelets are scaled by maximum of *neighborhood* LP sum - precisely, LP sum
    spanning from previous to next peak location relative to wavelet of interest:
    `max(lp_sum[peak_idx[n + 1]:peak_idx[n - 1]])`. This reliably accounts for
    discretization artifacts, including the non-CQT portion.

    "Nyquist correction" is done for the highest frequency wavelet; since it
    has no "preceding" wavelet, it's its own right bound (analytic; left for
    anti-), which overestimates necessary rescaling and makes resulting LP sum
    peak above target for the *next* wavelet.

    Multiple "passes" are done to improve overall accuracy, as not all edge
    case behavior is accounted for in one go (which is possible but complicated);
    the computational burden is minimal.


    Nyquist correction note
    -----------------------
    Current implementation accounts for the entire frequency axis, namely
    also including the region between highest wavelet's peak frequency and
    Nyquist. Doing otherwise, with `analytic=False`, can result in significant
    overshoot in that region, especially with small `Q` (and undershoot with
    `analytic=True`). Yet, current implementation also attenuates the
    next-highest center frequency with `analytic=True`, which is of greater
    importance for low `Q`, but attenuates only slightly. The implementation
    favors ridding of over/undershoots, as for JTFS the Nyquist frequential
    wavelet bears non-trivial energy, and the temporal wavelet isn't used anyway.

    The unused implementation is kept for reference, via `ncv==2`.

    Ideally we'd weight frequency bins to prioritize attaining a tight frame at
    likelier frequencies (for second orders this means lower frequencies), also
    ignore unused wavelets (e.g. j2==0), but that's beyond the scope of this
    implementation.
